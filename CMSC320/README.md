This folder consists of Projects developed for Introduction to Data Science CMSC320 at the University of Maryland College Park. This is my first in depth usage of python and SQLite.


Project 1 is an example of the usage of data scraping websites about solar flare activities which allows us to manipulate data to answer multiple questions. This also wrangles two different websites, then directly graphing and analysing the two collectively.

Project 2 is a step towards scraping a website which is formatted. We then compute multiple different values for monetary efficiency within MLB teams over time. We then transform data to develop claims on efficiency.
