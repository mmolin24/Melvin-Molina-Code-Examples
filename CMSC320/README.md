This folder consists of Projects developed for Introduction to Data Science CMSC320 at the University of Maryland College Park. This is my first in depth usage of python and SQLite.


Project 1 is an example of the usage of data scraping websites about solar flare activities which allows us to manipulate data to answer multiple questions. This also wrangles two different websites, then directly graphing and analysing the two collectively.

Project 2 is a step towards scraping a website which is formatted. We then compute multiple different values for monetary efficiency within MLB teams over time. We then transform data to develop claims on efficiency.

Project 3 consists of analysis of diving into the life expectation across multiple continents and trying to find a correlation. Also within this project a basic usage of linear regression is used. Also an analysis of breast cancer data is conducted usage of K nearest number and random forest modules from SKlearn.

Project 4 is a visual analysis of the crime statistics in baltimore, MD. This is heavy map related and changes the map visuals in order to get a different perspective of the maps. Very heavy usage of the folium module.
